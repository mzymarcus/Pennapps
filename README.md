# Pennapps

This is the program we built for PennApps Fall 2016; 

My friends and I form a team of three: 

1. Zhiyu Ma (me); 
2. Ziang Zhao; 
3. Yibo Chen; 

It is similar to a shooting game and it is totally implemented by C++; 

To run the program, just download the picture folder(under path PennApps/BarrageGame/BarrageGame)and "BarrageGame.cpp" (path PennApps/BarrageGame/BarrageGame) to the same directory on your own computer, then compile the program or you can simply run the .exe file we provide under path path PennApps/BarrageGame;

Hope you like it and enjoy playing the game;
